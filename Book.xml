    <abstract>
      <para>This is the planning document for salt integration of ceph. It 
      intends to cover use cases requirements and specification, and design ideas
      allowing us to keep out understanding of what our project has achieved and 
      what is still to be done clear and unamigiuous.

      <title>ceph salt Observations</title>
      <para>salt is a large tool kit and its easy to become overwelmed by 
      posibilities ofered buy salt to the user.</para>
      
      <para>I belive the process of design should be based upon:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Use cases</listitem>
        <listitem>Requirements</listitem>
        <listitem>Specifications</listitem>
        <listitem>Design</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <section id="preface_usecase">
        <title>Use cases</title>
        <para>Who and what is meant to be achived</para>
      </section>
      <section id="preface_requirements">
        <title>Requirements</title>
        <para>What we should be doing derived from use cases</para>
      </section>
      <section id="preface_specifications">
        <title>Specifications</title>
        <para>What we will be doing derived from requirements</para>
      </section>
      <section id="preface_design">
        <title>Design</title>
        <para>How we do it dervied from specifications.</para>
      </section>
      <para>This formallity will help us understand what and why we are doing things, 
      and allow management to track our progress.</para>
      <para>As the documentation matures I would relax the derivation rules such that 
      usecases can referance components that have been added to design, but to facilitate 
      large sprints we can relax it further to components added to the specifications.</para>
      <para>For example if we had a use case to confugre a "rbd service" we have dependanies 
      on things that have been placed in the specification about "dependacy managment."</para>
      <para>as a living document I suggest moving this into docbook on gitlab.</para>
      <para>This will allow us to use code review techniques to allow change control.</para>
      <para>This will allow us to have an ongoing mechanism to add fate requests to the 
      usecases, specifications.</para>
